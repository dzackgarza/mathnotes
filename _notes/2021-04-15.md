## Beilinson-Bloch Conjecture 

> Reference: Chao Li, "Beilinson-Bloch conjecture for unitary Shimura varieties". Priinceton/IAS NT Seminar

- What is the [../Beilinson-Bloch conjecture](../Beilinson-Bloch%20conjecture.md) conjecture?

- Beilinson-Bloch conjecture: generalizes the [BSD](../Birch%20and%20Swinnerton-Dyer%20conjecture.md) conjecture.
- What are higher [Chow groups](../Chow%20ring.md) ?
  What do they generalize?
  - Higher Chow groups: generalize the [Mordell-Weil group](Mordell-Weil%20group) for [elliptic curves](../elliptic%20curve.md)

- What is an [adele](../adele.md)? What is an [adelic](../adele.md) point?

- I should also review what a [place](../place.md)really is.
  Definitely what it means to be an [Archimedean place](Archimedean%20place).
  Also double-check the $v\divides \infty$ notation.

- What is an [automorphic representation](automorphic%20representation)?

- See [Gross-Zagier](Gross-Zagier) formula.

- What is a [../modular curve](../modular%20curve.md)? 
	
- What is a [Heegner divisor](../Heegner%20divisor.md) for some [imaginary quadratic field](imaginary%20quadratic%20field) over $\QQ$ and why can one use the theory of [CM](../complex%20multiplication.md) to get it defined over other fields?

- Gotta learn [modular forms](../modular%20form.md).
  They can take values in the complexification of a Mordell-Weil group?
  Also need to know something about [Hecke operators](Hecke%20operator).

- What is a [Shimura variety](Shimura%20variety)?

- What is a theta series?
  Something here called an *arithmetic theta lift*, where some pairing form generalizes Gross-Zagier (?).
  See Beilinson-Bloch height maybe?

- I should read a lot more about Chow groups.

- What is [Betti cohomology](Betti%20cohomology)?

- Why is proving that something is [modularity](../modular%20form.md) a *big deal*?

- Look for the Kudla Program in arithmetic geometry, and [Kudla-Rapoport conjecture](Kudla-Rapoport%20conjecture).

- Comment by Peter Sarnak: BSD was first checked numerically for CM elliptic curves! 

![image_2021-04-15-17-20-37](figures/image_2021-04-15-17-20-37.png)

- What is the characteristic function of a lattice?
  What is a self-dual [lattice](lattice)?

![Analogies between BSD and BB](figures/image_2021-04-15-17-21-23.png)

- What is a Siegel [Eisenstein series](Eisenstein%20series)?
  Or even just an Eisenstein series.

- See [Néron-Tate height](Néron-Tate%20height) pairing?
  Seems like these BB heights can only really be computed locally, then you have to sum over places.

- What are the [Standard conjectures](Standard%20conjectures)?
  
- Main formula and big theorem:

  ![image_2021-04-15-17-35-06](figures/image_2021-04-15-17-35-06.png)

  Seems that we know a lot about the LHS, the right-hand side is new.
  We don't know nondegeneracy of the RHS, for example, e.g. the pairing vanishing implying the cycle is zero.

  - Proof technique: "doubling".

- See [Tate conjecture](Tate%20conjecture).

- Comment from Peter Sarnak: we know very little about where $L$ functions vanish, except for $1/2$.

- Need to do [../Resolution of singularities](../Resolution%20of%20singularities.md) when you don't have a "regular" (integral?) model.

- Paper recommended by Juliette Bruce:
  <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02494.pdf>

  - Jonathan Love! 
  Shows some cool consequences of the [../Beilinson-Bloch conjecture](../Beilinson-Bloch%20conjecture.md), primarily a 2-parameter family of [Elliptic curves](../elliptic%20curve.md)  where the image $\CH^1(E_1)_0 \tensor \CH^1(E_2)_0 \to \CH^2(E_1 \cross E_2)$ is finite.
  BB predicts this is always finite when defined over $k$ a [number field](number%20field).

- I should remind myself what [local fields](../local%20field.md) and [global fields](../Global%20field.md) are.
