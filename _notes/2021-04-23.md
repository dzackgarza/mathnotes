## What is a scheme?

- <https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201711/rnoti-p1300.pdf>

- Manifolds are the place to do differential calculus, [schemes](../scheme.md) are the place to do algebra by finding zeros of functions.

- [Closed point](Closed%20point): of the form $V(S) \da \ts{ q\in \spec R \st q\contains S}$

## Time Management

- Setting goals: SMART.
  Doesn't work for research though!

  ![image_2021-04-23-15-54-19](figures/image_2021-04-23-15-54-19.png)

- Make lists, and habitually review/revise/plan.

- I really like the "keeping a problem list" idea.

- Don't be ashamed to ask people if they have problems you can work on.

## [Group Cohomology](Group%20Cohomology) in [Homotopy Theory](../Subjects/homotopy%20theory.md)?

Tags: #idle_thoughts

- Thinking about the link between group cohomology and homotopy theory: if I have a SES 
\[
0\to A \to B \to C \to 0
,\]
  should one apply a functor like $K(\wait, 1)$?
  Is this actually a functor...?
  We definitely get spaces $K(A, 1)$ and $K(B, 1)$, for example, and there must be an induced map between them.
  Want to make precise what it means to get a SES like this:
  \[
  0 \to K(A, 1) \to K(B, 1) \to K(C, 1) \to 0
  .\]
  One would kind of want this to be part of a [fiber sequence](fiber%20sequence) I guess.
  But we're in $\Top$ anyway, so there's no real issue with just doing [cofibrant replacement](../fibrant%20and%20cofibrant%20objects.md),.

  Maybe the "right" think to do here is to actually take a classifying [../groupoid](../groupoid.md) (?), which must be some functor like $\B: \Grp \to \Grpd$.
  Surely this is some known thing.
  But then what is an "exact sequence of groupoids"...?
  \[
  0 \to \B A \to \B B \to \B C \to 0
  .\]

  Also, why should such a functor be an exact? 
  It'd kind of be more interesting if it *weren't*.
  Say it's right-exact, then how might you make sense of $\Ld \B(\wait)$?
  I think this just needs a model category structure on the *source*, although it seems reasonable to expect that $\Grpd$ would have some simple model structure.


## SeZoom

[../l-adic representations](../l-adic%20representations.md)

- Try computing things like $\Gal (\QQ( \zeta_3, \sqrt{3})$.

- There's some way to check orders of Galois groups using [valuations](../valuation.md)..?

- See Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion: [good reduction](good%20reduction) iff [Inertia](../Inertia.md) acts trivially, or [semistable reduction](semistable%20reduction) iff inertia acts [unipotently](unipotently).

- Always have quasi-unipotently, so eigenvalues roots of unity.
	- Easy for [Elliptic curves](../elliptic%20curve.md). 
	- For [abelian varieties](../moduli%20stack%20of%20abelian%20varieties.md), requires [Néron models](Néron%20models), see Silverman.

- [Galois representations](Galois%20representations) at different primes are related, using local info at a few primes to get global info at all primes.
