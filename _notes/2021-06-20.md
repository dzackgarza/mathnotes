  - $K^\alg(\SS)$ is of interest due to Waldhausen's stable parameterized [h-cobordism theorem](../h-cobordism%20theorem.md).
    - How to understand it: look at [Galois descent](Galois%20descent) on $K(\ZZ)$
- A first approximation: $K^\alg(L_{K(n)} \SS)$, so localize with respect to [Morava K-theory](../Morava%20K-theory.md)
- Rognes extends [Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures](Lichtenbaum-Quillen%20conjectures) and develops a theory for Galois extensions of $\SS\dash$algebras
- [Redshift](Redshift): [algebraic K-theory](algebraic%20K-theory) increases [chromatic complexity](chromatic%20complexity) by one.
