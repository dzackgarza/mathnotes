## Random Algebraic Topology

> Reference: paper on "constructive" algebraic topology
[J. Rubio, F. Sergeraert / Bull. Sci. math. 126 (2002) 389â€“412 403](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Papers/Constructive-AT.pdf)

- Many constructions in algebraic topology can be organized as solutions of fibration problems.

- What are [Quillen equivalences](../Quillen%20equivalence.md)? 
	#unanswered_questions
 	These need to preserve the [model structure](model%20structure) on each side presumably.

- More fundamental: how *should* one prove an [../equivalence of categories](../equivalence%20of%20categories.md) in general? 
  	#unanswered_questions
 
- Finding [adjunctions](../adjunction.md) is usually easy, because checking isomorphisms on hom sets is concrete.
  
- If you just have a random functor, does it even *have* right or left adjoints in general? 
	There must be theorems about this.
  	#unanswered_questions

- What is the [../Stiefel manifold](../Stiefel%20manifold.md)? 
 	#unanswered_questions
	- I should write down an explicit set-theoretic description somewhere. This is definitely in Fomenko.

## 19:38

- Is there a natural exact sequence associated to a [composition series](composition%20series)? 
  	#unanswered_questions
	- This seems like it should be super easy, we have quotients everywhere.
	- Is there a precise relation to [iterated extensions](iterated%20extensions)..? 
  	#unanswered_questions
