- Some big conjectures in AG/NT:
  - The [Ash Conjecture](Ash%20Conjecture):
    [Galois representations](Galois%20representations) coming from torsion cohomology classes of locally [symmetric spaces](symmetric%20spaces).
  - Deligne's [weight monodromy conjecture](weight%20monodromy%20conjecture):
    Something to do with [complete intersections](complete%20intersections).
- What's the deal with [Prismatic cohomology](Prismatic%20cohomology)?
  - Something coming from Bhatt: an integral version of [p-adic Hodge theory](p-adic%20Hodge%20theory) which is supposed to link a bunch of other cohomology theories.
