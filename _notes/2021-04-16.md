- What is the [universal curve](universal%20curve) over $M_g$?
	#unanswered_questions 

- What is the [tautological ring](tautological%20ring), and how does it relate to the [Chow Ring](../Chow%20ring.md)?
	#unanswered_questions 

- What are the $\kappa$ classes?
	#unanswered_questions 
	
- Question: when does $A^*(M_g) = R^*(M_g)$?

- The integral Chow ring is *very* unknown. 
	We know it only very recently for $M_2, \bar{M_2}$. 
	Compare to rational Chow rings: we know them as quotients of polynomial rings for $M_g, g\leq 23$.

- Can stratify $M_g$ by [gonality](gonality).

- What are [hyperelliptic](hyperelliptic) curves?

  > I definitely have known this at several points in time, yeesh.

- Look at [Hurwitz space](Hurwitz%20space): [moduli space](../moduli%20space.md) of degree $n$ covers of $\PP^1$ by smooth genus $g$ [../curves](../curves.md)? 
	At least this specific one is.
