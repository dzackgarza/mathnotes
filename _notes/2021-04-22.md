## Gromov-Witten Invariants in Derived AG 

- My main question: does introducing derived stacks somehow make *some* computation easier?
	#unanswered_questions 

	- I haven't found any explicit computations of these, but sources alluded to actual counts (numbers) conjecturally coming from physics, where a few have been verified.

- Integrating over a [fundamental class](fundamental%20class):

## Derived Stacks 

- We can't prove the [Tate conjecture](Tate%20conjecture)?
  I guess this is an arithmetic analog of the [Hodge conjecture](Hodge%20conjecture). 
  Serre's book calls some isomorphism the Tate conjecture and says it's proved though.

- Pithy explanation of a [derived scheme](derived%20scheme): a space which can be covered by Zariski opens $Y\cong \spec A^*$ where $A\in \cdga_{k}$.

  - [Schemes](Schemes) and [2021-04-26_Stacks](../stack.md) can be very singular. 
  
  - [Derived schemes](Derived%20schemes) and [derived stacks](derived%20stacks) act a bit like smooth, nonsingular objects.
	  - Morphisms behave like they are transverse?

- Derived modular stacks of [coherent sheaves](coherent%20sheaves) over $X$ remember the entire [../deformation theory](../deformation%20theory.md) of sheaves on $X$.
  - The homology of its "tangent space" at a point $[E]$ is $\Ext^*(E, E)$, which only holds in restricted degrees if you only use a non-derived moduli scheme or stack.
