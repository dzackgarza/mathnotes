- [Algebraic de Rham complex](Algebraic%20de%20Rham%20complex):
![image_2021-05-06-11-15-55](figures/image_2021-05-06-11-15-55.png)

- Can get a derived version: take *non-abelian derived functors*, i.e. take a [../simplicial resolution](../simplicial%20resolution.md) by simplicial polynomial algebras and apply the functor to the resolution.
  - Equivalently a left [kan extension](../Kan%20extension.md)?
- Define $\Ld \Omega^1 _{A/R}$ to be the [cotangent complex](../cotangent%20complex.md) and take derived exterior powers for the other degrees.
- Derived [Hodge filtration](Hodge%20filtration) may not be complete, so take completion: take cone (cofiber?) in derived category and take a hocolim.

![image_2021-05-06-11-20-04](figures/image_2021-05-06-11-20-04.png)

- Fact: de Rham complex has a universal property, initial (strictly, so odd elements square to zero) commutative [DGA](../differential%20graded%20algebras.md) receiving a map $A\to X^0$, so the initial way to turn an algebra into a DGA.
  Does the derived version have a similar property?

- [2021-04-26_hochschild_homology](../Hochschild%20homology.md) is defined as $\HH(A/R) \da A^{\tensor_R S^1}$ the $S^1$ tensoring, take [Homotopy fixed points](Homotopy%20fixed%20points) to get [$\HC^-$](cyclic%20homology).
- Associated graded of $\HH$ recovers derived de Rham:

![image_2021-05-06-11-25-44](figures/image_2021-05-06-11-25-44.png)

  - Why does this happen? $\HH(A/R)$ is the initial [simplicial R-algebra](../simplicial%20algebra.md) with an $S^1\dash$action receiving a map from $A$.
  - Analogies
    - [simplicial rings](../simplicial%20ring.md) $\mapstofrom$ [CDGAs](../differential%20graded%20algebras.md)
    - $S^1$ action $\mapstofrom$ the differential

- Can take homotopy groups of $\HH$????

> Reference: Andrew Blumberg, Floer homotopy theory and Morava K-theory. 
  Princeton Algebraic Topology Seminar

- Topic: [Floer homotopy theory](Floer%20homotopy%20theory)

- Some relevant things about [Morava K-theory](../Morava%20K-theory.md), which will be coefficients that we take.

![Tate construction and homotopy orbits/fixed points in the norm map](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-11-30.png)

- Produce a virtual fundamental class for flow categories.
  Moduli spaces of trajectories appearing will be "derived [2021-04-26_Stacks_and_Orbifolds](../orbifold.md)".

  - Use some derived/spectral version of the usual [Novikov ring](Novikov%20ring)?

- Flow category:
![image_2021-05-06-13-15-11](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-15-11.png)

  - Enriched in spaces
  - Use a so-called *Kuranishi flow category*.
  - Uses [norm map](norm%20map)

- Where do flow categories come from?
  One natural source: Morse functions.
  Objects are critical points, morphisms are roughly trajectories.

- Given a functor $\cat{C} \to \Sp$ out of a flow category, can construct a spectrum as a $\hocolim$.
  Turns Floer data into stable homotopy data?

![image_2021-05-06-13-17-37](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-17-37.png)

- Defining a flow category:

![image_2021-05-06-13-18-44](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-18-44.png)

  - Morphisms are moduli spaces of Floer trajectories, i.e. flow lines using the symplectic form?

  - Action map $A: P\to \RR$ given by integration, objects of $P$ form a poset.

  - Action induces a filtration $P_{ \lambda} \da \ts{ p\in P \st A(p) < \lambda}$.

  - Get filtered modules, need to work with a completion of this filtration.
    Tough to build/describe, uses point-set language and zigzags.
    Maybe easier in infty-categorical language?

- Get an $E_2$ ring spectrum -- not great! 
  But there is an Ore condition that makes things nicer.

- Can express enrichments in terms of [lax functors](../lax%20functor.md) from an indexing 2-category
  - Cats of objects of set type $S$ and morphism type $V$ are lax functors from some indiscrete indexing 2-category (associated to $S$?) to a [bicategory](bicategory) associated to $V$.
  - Lax functors of bicategories: yikes.
  - A lot of [homotopy coherence](homotopy%20coherence) problems to deal with.

- How does one construct the [virtual fundamental class](virtual%20fundamental%20class)?
  Under orientability hypothesis, have some kind of [Alexander duality](Alexander%20duality).

![image_2021-05-06-13-32-51](figures/image_2021-05-06-13-32-51.png)

- See the [Borel construction](Borel%20construction), the [Adams isomorphism](Adams%20isomorphism), [ambidexterity](../ambidexterity.md).
  - Orientability hypothesis allows using the [Thom isomorphism](Thom%20isomorphism) on [equivariant cobordism](equivariant%20cobordism).
    See [complex stability](complex%20stability).
  - Uses some model of iterated cones, similar to Khovanov stuff?

- Cover moduli space by Kuranishi charts $(X, G, s, Y)$
  - Symmetric monoidal structure is basically component-wise.
  - Morphisms are complicated, essentially involves transversality conditions (free actions, topological submersions, etc).
  - Stronger requirements than what John Pardon (?) imposes in his work on [virtual fundamental classes](virtual%20fundamental%20classes).

- Technical issues with loop actions on categories, only get module structure on homotopy category?
  - Also issues with local-to-global coherence, need $\hocolim$ to be compatible with Kuranishi atlases?
    And technical tools like [Adams isomorphism](Adams%20isomorphism) and [norm map](norm%20map).
    Need lots of [../equivariant stable homotopy theory](../equivariant%20stable%20homotopy%20theory.md).
  - Substantial difficulties extracting this data from the symplectic structure.
    - "This data": stratified oriented Kuranishi structures?
  - Build a spectrum with some [bar construction](bar%20construction).

- Can get the [Arnold conjecture](Arnold%20conjecture) from this homotopy type!
  I.e. $\rank \HF_*(H, \Lambda) \leq \#\text{ orbits}$, here we're taking homotopy groups.
  $H$ is a [../Hamiltonian](../Hamiltonian.md).
  - Can split $H_*(M; \Lambda)$ off from $\HF_*(H; \Lambda)$.

  - Recover statement about $\HF_p$ cohomology using the [AHSS](../Atiyah%20Hirzebruch%20spectral%20sequence.md).

- Technical problems: virtual cochains are not functorial in morphisms of Kuranishi charts.
  No canonical map between certain cofibers.
  There are maps, they require choices, tracking them is tough.

  - Solution: degenerate to the [normal cone](normal%20cone) to produce [zigzags](zigzags).

  - Sits between two Kuranishi charts by looking at the ends of the cone.

- A lot of cool stuff for homotopy theorists to do here!
  - See Cohen-Jones-Segal.
  - Homotopy theory should yield interesting symplectic consequences.
  - Work to build spectrally enriched [Fukaya categories](../Fukaya%20category.md).
  - Should be doing [global homotopy theory](global%20homotopy%20theory) or global homology, yielding a nicer way to describe all of this.
    Rezk is a proponent!

  - Can one do this over other spectra?
  Need strong [orientability](../Orientability%20of%20spectra.md) conditions.
  Don't expect a lift to the [sphere spectrum](sphere%20spectrum), but maybe $\ku, \mu$.

- Improvement over rational results when there is torsion.
  May not improve over numerical bounds for special classes of [Symplectic manifolds](../Symplectic%20geometry.md).

- [Morava K-theory](../Morava%20K-theory.md) is useful here because it behaves well with respect to finite groups
  - Want to dualize [classifying spaces](../classifying%20space.md) of [orbifolds](../orbifold.md), use Poincaré duality for orbifolds.
    Equivariant stuff appears as an alternative to going to $H_*(X; \QQ)$.
- Comment by Morava: the $p=2$ case may be resolvable, see Boardman's last paper.
  Set up some category of modules over the $p=2$ [Bockstein](Bockstein).

- Theorem/conjecture: if $\sigma$ is [tempered](tempered) everywhere, there is a formula:
